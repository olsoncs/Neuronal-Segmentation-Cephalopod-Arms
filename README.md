# Neuronal-Segmentation-Cephalopod-Arms

Cassady S. Olson

This code analyzes the data for "Neuronal segmentation in cephalopod arms" by Cassady S. Olson, Natalie Grace Schulz, and Clifton W. Ragsdale. Each folder contains an additional README file to describe use of code along with a subset of data to run the code. If you use this data or code, please cite Olson, Schulz, and Ragsdale (2024).

****************
**DensityCalculation:** Semi-automatically counts number of cells and computes an area of an image for density caclulations.

**Measurement:** Examines segment measurements down the proximal-distal axis of the octopus arm. 

**NerveAnalysis:** Analyzes the pattern of brachial nerve fibers and oral nerve fibers in the octopus arm.
